 <p align="right"> I don't fall in love anymore, I rise in it </p>
 <p align="right"> I... am the architect of my own destruction </p>
 <p> I did this again... I pushed away the one I love. I always do so. What's much more important is that 
  one more time I made a promise that I couldn't keep. I broke it the very next day after saying "I would never, ever hurt you...".
  This moment when you realise that you've hurt someone valuable, nothing makes sense, your work, your plans, your dreams, nothing, it just fades away.
  Guess some people are just meant to be alone after all. I am the despair itself. </p>
