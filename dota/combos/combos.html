        <p>
            Both are line dominators in 7.32C, Undying takes huge advantage of the mana regen aura. Just please buy
            a bunch of mangoes (mangoes were slightly nerfed up to 7.32e in terms of health regen, still a decent mana
            burst) on both of
            them. Their synergy in team-fights is descent as well, so it's not only the lane phase

        <p>
            Matrix reduces cooldown with level 20 talent, if you add Octarine core the Willow won't get out of realm
            duration for like 20 sec. Also Willow is just crazy now (7.32C), get the Ocrarine and Shadow Realm talents
            -> you will have like about 1.5 sec window without the realm, you can spend this time in the Eul's,
            basically only DPS item you need is the Witchblade

        <p>
            With Bloodrage and Overcharge buffs, Zeus will deal about 1k damage with JUST his ult in mid-game. Keep in
            mind you need the spell damage talent on Bloodseker and Agh's shard on IO. And of course you build spell
            amplification on Zeus

        <p>
            Besides from the call and Death Ward combo which is already extremely good, battle hunger and maledict at
            lvl 1 thrown at the enemy support will make his life at the lane miserable, to make things worse for your
            enemy try rushing urn on WD and keep in mind that Axe is a gread Wraith Pact buyer (WP is op in 7.32C),
            optimal timing for it is right after Vanguard-blink (maybe blademail)

        <p>
            Apparently, Nature's Wrath is a point target skill, that means you can take advantage
            of Soulbind for it, and the damage is ridiculous, you basically have a free refresher at level 6.
            Ultimately you want global vision here, so you also want to<b> add a Zeus or Spectre </b>
        </p>

        <p>
            Just get a Maelstrom on all of them, they do a bunch of hits quite quickly due to their
            respective abilities. It's about 1k damage with just a maelstrom and 1 skill from each at lvl 7
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=grimmstroke />
            <img data-id=bountyHunter />
        </div>
        <p>
            Bounty Hunter rushes Aghanim's scepter to enable his damage and steal all money. And Soulbind just doubles
            it
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">

        <p>
            Extremely high (or global) range abilities, harass or even kill enemies without giving them chance to
            respond.
            You can of course take this combo partially, pick any 2-3 heroes from here, it's still good. If you focus on
            the high range damage, this is probably a position 4 Sniper and mid Zeus
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=ogre>
            <img data-id=primal>
        </div>
        <p>
            Both are descent laners so it's a most likely lane win. Also Primal Beast takes huge advantage of the
            Bloodlust
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=kotl>
            <img data-id=undying>
        </div>
        <p>
            Undying is still a pain in the ass himself, so what happens if you add kotl here? You get even MORE slow and
            extra magic damage on enemy heroes with Solar Bind (at level 1). Now for lvl 2, we get Chakra Magic so that
            Undying can spam his fucking decays even more AND get the
            cooldwon reduction, this is just ridiculous and should be a abused. For this combo you probably want to skip
            Illuminate and focus on buffing the Undying, maybe get Illuminate after the lane stage
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=zeus>
            <img data-id=grimmstroke>
        </div>
        <p>
            Double arc lightning spam is just crazy, the damage output from it will be ridiculous. Get Aether Lense on
            both of them for extra cast range -> safety. I believe you can add a Witch Doctor here to confuse enemy with
            double casks and win more time and space for Zeus to spam his Q
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=axe>
            <img data-id=witchDoctor>
            <img data-id=medusa>
        </div>
        <p>
            Death Ward is a high physic damage spell, so what can greatly amplify physic damage? Medusa's Stone Gaze,
            now it does have a disadvantage, we all know it, it's the fact the enemy heroes must look at the Medusa, so
            how can we make them do that? Berseker's call, Axe can blink in and walk to Medusa making the enemy face
            her. Now you might also acomplish the same result with fear, for example from terrorize, but it will require
            accurate position and high mobility from Medusa, so the Call is much easier to enable this combo. I'd love
            to <b>add a Grimmstroke here to do a double snake and casks, and don't underestimate double snake with
                Medusa's aghs </b>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=chen>
            <img data-id=witchDoctor>
        </div>
        <p>
            <b>High Complication Level!</b> Chen increases attack speed of every unit attacking his target and this will
            work with the Death Ward, so you can focus a single target pretty heavily. After you get aghs on the Witch
            Doctor it's not a single target any more but you will still have to focus the debuffed by Chen hero
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=dragonKnight>
            <img data-id=rubick>
        </div>
        <p>
            This is more of a sustainable lane combo than killing. Dragon Breath and Fade Bolt both reduce damage
            output, so
            if you rush the Soul Ring on DK, and get a few mangos on Rubick, you can pretty much deny most of the lane
            creeps and that's a huge impact on team networth advantage. In the mid-game DK is a descent Wraith
            Pact buyer and frontliner for Rubick to cast his stolen spells
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=sf>
            <img data-id=arcaneBlink>
        </div>
        <p>
            No joking :) this hero just needs the arcane blink, basically any crowd control will enable him even
            further. Abuse before it's fixed (op in 7.32C)
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=bloodseeker>
            <img data-id=disruptor>
            <img data-id=grimmstroke>
        </div>
        <p>
            Glimpse counts as traveling for the Rupture, that's basically it, of course add a Force Staff (or 2) here
            for extra brain damage. Grimmstroke's Soulbind just makes it twice as ridiculous. So the combo goes like
            this:
            Soulbind - Rupture - all Force Staves you have - Glimpse
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=weaver>
            <img data-id=grimmstroke>
            <img data-id=lich>
        </div>
        <p>
            Double chainfrost is just ridiculous, one chainfrost is good enought already but with soul bind you
            basically have a free refresher. Of course you don't want Lich and Grimmstroke on the same lane so Weaver is
            a nice Ink Swell enabler, and also minus armor with silence combines really well together because the enemy
            won't be able to kill both the Swarm and Phantom at the early stage
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=muerta>
            <img data-id=pudge>
        </div>
        <p>
            Muerta provides a failry easy fear with a move direction control which makes hook landings way easier.
            I don't need to tell you how much successful hooks affect the lane winning
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=witchDoctor>
            <img data-id=io>
        </div>
        <p>
            it seems the amplification of heal is actually a big deal, it's really hard to kill those two and damage output is quite decent
        </p>
