            Both are line dominators in 7.32C, Undying takes huge advantage of the mana regen aura. Just please buy
            bunch of mangos on both of
            them. Their synergy in team-fights is descent as well, so it's not only the lane phase

            Matrix reduces cooldown with level 20 talent, if you add Octarine core the Willow won't get out of realm
            duration for like 20 sec. Also Willow is just crazy now (7.32C), get the Ocrarine and Shadow Realm talents
            -> you will have like about 1.5 sec window without the realm, you can spend this time in the Eul's,
            basically only DPS item you need is the Witchblade
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
            With Bloodrage and Overcharge buffs, Zeus will deal about 1k damage with JUST his ult in mid-game. Keep in
            mind you need the spell damage talent on Bloodseker and Agh's shard on IO. And of course you build spell
            amplification on Zeus

        <p>
            Besides from the call and Death Ward combo which is already extremely good, battle hunger and maledict at
            lvl 1 thrown at the enemy support will make his life at the lane miserable, to make things worse for your
            enemy try rushing urn on WD and keep in mind that Axe is a gread Wraith Pact buyer (WP is op in 7.32C),
            optimal timing for it is right after Vanguard-blink (maybe blademail)

        <p>
            Apparently, Nature's Wrath is a point target skill, that means you can take advantage
            of Soulbind for it, and the damage is ridiculous, you basically have a free refresher at level 6.
            Ultimately you want global vision here, so you also want to<b> add a Zeus or Spectre </b>

            Just get a Maelstrom on all of them, they do a bunch of hits quite quickly due to their
            respective abilities. It's about 1k damage with just a maelstrom and 1 skill from each at lvl 7
        </p>

            <img data-id=bountyHunter />
        </div>
        <p>
            Bounty Hunter rushes Aghanim's scepter to enable his damage and steal all money. And Soulbind just doubles
            it
        </p>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">

            Extremely high (or global) range abilities, harass or even kill enemies without giving them chance to
            respond.
            You can of course take this combo partially, pick any 2-3 heroes from here, it's still good
        </p>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=ogre>
            <img data-id=primal>
        </div>
        <p>
            Both are descent laners so it's a most likely lane win. Also Primal Beast takes huge advantage of the
            Bloodlust
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=kotl>
            <img data-id=undying>
        </div>
        <p>
            Undying is still a pain in the ass himself, so what happens if you add kotl here? You get even MORE slow and
            extra magic damage on enemy heroes with Solar Bind, that's only 1 skill and already enables the Undying that
            much. Now for lvl 2, we get Chakra Magic so that Undying can spam his fucking decays even more AND get the
            cooldwon reduction, this is just ridiculous and should be a abused. The crowd control in the mid-game is
            synergized pretty well too, you get the taunt and misses from kotl, more slow and hp sucking from Undying, I
            would hate to play against this combo.

            double arc lightning spam is just crazy, the damage output from it will be ridiculous
