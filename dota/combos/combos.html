        </div>
        <p>
            Both are line dominators in 7.32C, Undying takes huge advantage of the mana regen aura. Just please buy
            a bunch of mangoes (mangoes were slightly nerfed up to 7.32e in terms of health regen, still a decent mana
            burst) on both of
            them. Their synergy in team-fights is descent as well, so it's not only the lane phase
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
            With Bloodrage and Overcharge buffs, Zeus will deal about 1k damage with JUST his ult in mid-game. Keep in
            mind you need the spell damage talent on Bloodseker and Agh's shard on IO. And of course you build spell
            amplification on Zeus

        <p>
            Besides from the call and Death Ward combo which is already quite impressive, battle hunger and maledict at
            lvl 1 thrown at the enemy support will make his life at the lane miserable, to make things worse for your
            enemy try rushing urn on WD
        </p>

    <div class="comboWrapper">

        </div>
        <p>
            Apparently, Nature's Wrath is a point target skill, that means you can take advantage
            of Soulbind for it, and the damage is ridiculous, you basically have a free refresher at level 6.
            Ultimately you want global vision here, so you also want to<b> add a Zeus or Spectre </b>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">

        </div>
        <p>
            Just get a Maelstrom on all of them, they do a bunch of hits quite quickly due to their
            respective abilities. It's about 1k damage with just a maelstrom and 1 skill from each at lvl 7
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=grimmstroke>
            <img data-id=bountyHunter>
        </div>
        <p>
            Bounty Hunter rushes Aghanim's scepter to enable his damage and steal all money. And Soulbind just doubles
            it
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=zeus>

            <img data-id=aa>
            <img data-id=spectre>
        </div>
        <p>
            Extremely high (or global) range abilities, harass or even kill enemies without giving them chance to
            respond.
            You can of course take this combo partially, pick any 2-3 heroes from here, it's still good. If you focus on
            the high range damage, this is probably a position 4 Sniper and mid Zeus
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=ogre>
            <img data-id=primal>
        </div>
        <p>
            Both are descent laners so it's a most likely lane win. Also Primal Beast takes huge advantage of the
            Bloodlust
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=kotl>
            <img data-id=undying>
        </div>
        <p>
            Undying is still a pain in the ass himself, so what happens if you add kotl here? You get even MORE slow and
            extra magic damage on enemy heroes with Solar Bind (at level 1). Now for lvl 2, we get Chakra Magic so that
            Undying can spam his fucking decays even more AND get the
            cooldwon reduction, this is just ridiculous and should be a abused. For this combo you probably want to skip
            Illuminate and focus on buffing the Undying, maybe get Illuminate after the lane stage
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=zeus>
            <img data-id=grimmstroke>
        </div>
        <p>
            Double arc lightning spam is just crazy, the damage output from it will be ridiculous. Get Aether Lense on
            both of them for extra cast range -> safety. I believe you can add a Witch Doctor here to confuse enemy with
            double casks and win more time and space for Zeus to spam his Q
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=axe>
            <img data-id=witchDoctor>
            <img data-id=medusa>
        </div>
        <p>
            Death Ward is a high physic damage spell, so what can greatly amplify physic damage? Medusa's Stone Gaze,
            now it does have a disadvantage, we all know it, it's the fact the enemy heroes must look at the Medusa, so
            how can we make them do that? Berseker's call, Axe can blink in and walk to Medusa making the enemy face
            her. Now you might also acomplish the same result with fear, for example from terrorize, but it will require
            accurate position and high mobility from Medusa, so the Call is much easier to enable this combo. I'd love
            to <b>add a Grimmstroke here to do a double snake and casks, and don't underestimate double snake with
                Medusa's aghs </b>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=bloodseeker>
            <img data-id=disruptor>
            <img data-id=grimmstroke>
        </div>
        <p>
            Glimpse counts as traveling for the Rupture, that's basically it, of course add a Force Staff (or 2) here
            for extra brain damage. Grimmstroke's Soulbind just makes it twice as ridiculous. So the combo goes like
            this:
            Soulbind - Rupture - all Force Staves you have - Glimpse
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=weaver>
            <img data-id=grimmstroke>
            <img data-id=lich>
        </div>
        <p>
            Double chainfrost is just ridiculous, one chainfrost is good enought already but with soul bind you
            basically have a free refresher. Of course you don't want Lich and Grimmstroke on the same lane so Weaver is
            a nice Ink Swell enabler, and also minus armor with silence combines really well together because the enemy
            won't be able to kill both the Swarm and Phantom at the early stage
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=witchDoctor>
            <img data-id=io>
        </div>
        <p>
            it seems the amplification of heal is actually a big deal, it's really hard to kill those two and damage
            output
            is quite decent
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=pugna>
            <img data-id=kotl>
        </div>
        <p>
            That's a hardlane combo with ridiculous magic damage amplification, slows from decrepify and soul bind make
            things worse for your enemy
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo" id="silencer-skymage">
            <img data-id=skymage>
            <img data-id=silencer>
        </div>
        <p>
            Arcane curse takes advantage of an instant silence from skymage amplyfying the damage output, also skymage
            has some decent nukes to ruin the carry's life on the lane
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=grimmstroke>
            <img data-id=warlock>
        </div>
        <p>
            Double fatal bonds, that just hurts. Might want to add a zeus for easy damage in bonds or lich to make it a
            next level
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=lancer>
            <img data-id=grimmstroke>
        </div>
        <p>
            New aghanim in 7.33 for Lancer makes his spear bounce 3 times, that makes 6 illusions with the soul
            bind, and you can cast it twice during the duration, that makes 12 illusions that just shatter enemies
            down, you need a moonshard here since illusions take 100% of your attack speed
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=techies>
            <img data-id=spectre>
        </div>
        <p>
            First, both are in the meta now (7.33d), second, you place some proximity mines and then spectre haunts the
            prey and finishes the business, it could work with spirit breaker as well, but spectre is just faster. Also
            the minefield, if you succeed placing it inside the fight, and then Spectre haunts, people will die
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=morphling>
            <img data-id=rubick>
            <img data-id=shadowDemon>
            <img data-id=darkSeer>
            <img data-id=grimmstroke>
        </div>
        <p>
            That's actually really funny, you replicate enemies skills with morph and Rubick, and than the other 3
            create their illusions, imaging picking it against a spectre or phantom lancer
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=medusa>
            <img data-id=pugna>
            <img data-id=lion>
        </div>
        <p>
            With this you can literally rush rapiers on medusa, lion and pugna can both suck hp and mana into her, so
            she just can't be killed
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=tide>
            <img data-id=enigma>
        </div>
        <p>
            2 extremely strong ultimates, but that's not even the point. It's very easy to win the lane due to minus
            armor and heavy physical damage from eidolons so you just remove the enemy carry most of the time. Yes it's
            pos-4 Tide and pos-3 Enigma
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=wraithKing>
            <img data-id=warlock>
        </div>
        <p>
            Basically summon chaos, early on you can pressure hard with skeletons and imps
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=pudge>
            <img data-id=necro>
        </div>
        <p>
            This is stupid, but you can just afk rot enemies. Pudge gives you HP regen amp, you HP regen damages enemies
            with your aghs, so Pudge eats the Necro and goes rotting and tanking, and just doing pudge stuff, all you
            need is aghs a sange and some hearts
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=bristle>
            <img data-id=kotl>
        </div>
        <p>
            This is almost classic, but with added 2 active skills with aghs and shard you can take it to the next level with chakra magic
        </p>
