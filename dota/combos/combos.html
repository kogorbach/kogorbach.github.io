        <p>
            Both are line dominators in 7.32C, Undying takes huge advantage of the mana regen aura. Just please buy
            a bunch of mangoes (mangoes were slightly nerfed up to 7.32e in terms of health regen, still a decent mana
            burst) on both of
            them. Their synergy in team-fights is descent as well, so it's not only the lane phase

            Matrix reduces cooldown with level 20 talent, if you add Octarine core the Willow won't get out of realm
            duration for like 20 sec. Also, Willow is just crazy now (7.32C), get the Ocrarine and Shadow Realm talents
            -> you will have like about 1.5 sec window without the realm, you can spend this time in the Eul's,
            basically only DPS item you need is the Witchblade

            With Bloodrage and Overcharge buffs, Zeus will deal about 1k damage with JUST his ult in mid-game. Keep in
            mind you need the spell damage talent on Bloodseker and Agh's shard on IO. And of course you build spell
            amplification on Zeus

            Besides from the call and Death Ward combo which is already quite impressive, battle hunger and maledict at
            lvl 1 thrown at the enemy support will make his life at the lane miserable, to make things worse for your
            enemy try rushing urn on WD

        <p>
            Apparently, Nature's Wrath is a point target skill, that means you can take advantage
            of Soulbind for it, and the damage is ridiculous, you basically have a free refresher at level 6.
            Ultimately you want global vision here, so you also want to<b> add a Zeus or Spectre </b>

            Just get a Maelstrom on all of them, they do a bunch of hits quite quickly due to their
            respective abilities. It's about 1k damage with just a maelstrom and 1 skill from each at lvl 7
        </p>

        <p>
            Bounty Hunter rushes Aghanim's scepter to enable his damage and steal all money. And Soulbind just doubles
            it
        </p>

        <p>
            Extremely high (or global) range abilities, harass or even kill enemies without giving them chance to
            respond.
            You can of course take this combo partially, pick any 2-3 heroes from here, it's still good. If you focus on
            the high range damage, this is probably a position 4 Sniper and mid Zeus
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=ogre>
            <img data-id=primal>
        </div>
        <p>
            Both are descent laners so it's a most likely lane win. Also Primal Beast takes huge advantage of the
            Bloodlust
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=kotl>
            <img data-id=undying>
        </div>
        <p>
            Undying is still a pain in the ass himself, so what happens if you add kotl here? You get even MORE slow and
            extra magic damage on enemy heroes with Solar Bind (at level 1). Now for lvl 2, we get Chakra Magic so that
            Undying can spam his fucking decays even more AND get the
            cooldwon reduction, this is just ridiculous and should be a abused. For this combo you probably want to skip
            Illuminate and focus on buffing the Undying, maybe get Illuminate after the lane stage
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=zeus>

        </div>
        <p>
            Double arc lightning spam is just crazy, the damage output from it will be ridiculous. Get Aether Lense on
            both of them for extra cast range -> safety. I believe you can add a Witch Doctor here to confuse enemy with
            double casks and win more time and space for Zeus to spam his Q
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=axe>
            <img data-id=witchDoctor>
            <img data-id=medusa>
        </div>
        <p>
            Death Ward is a high physic damage spell, so what can greatly amplify physic damage? Medusa's Stone Gaze,
            now it does have a disadvantage, we all know it, it's the fact the enemy heroes must look at the Medusa, so
            how can we make them do that? Berseker's call, Axe can blink in and walk to Medusa making the enemy face
            her. Now you might also acomplish the same result with fear, for example from terrorize, but it will require
            accurate position and high mobility from Medusa, so the Call is much easier to enable this combo. I'd love
            to <b>add a Grimmstroke here to do a double snake and casks, and don't underestimate double snake with
                Medusa's aghs </b>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=chen>
            <img data-id=witchDoctor>
        </div>
        <p>
            <b>High Complication Level!</b> Chen increases attack speed of every unit attacking his target and this will
            work with the Death Ward, so you can focus a single target pretty heavily. After you get aghs on the Witch
            Doctor it's not a single target any more but you will still have to focus the debuffed by Chen hero
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=dragonKnight>
            <img data-id=rubick>
        </div>
        <p>
            This is more of a sustainable lane combo than killing. Dragon Breath and Fade Bolt both reduce damage
            output, so
            if you rush the Soul Ring on DK, and get a few mangos on Rubick, you can pretty much deny most of the lane
            creeps and that's a huge impact on team networth advantage. In the mid-game DK is a descent Wraith
            Pact buyer and frontliner for Rubick to cast his stolen spells
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=sf>
            <img data-id=arcaneBlink>
        </div>
        <p>
            No joking :) this hero just needs the arcane blink, basically any crowd control will enable him even
            further. Abuse before it's fixed (op in 7.32C)
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">

            <img data-id=grimmstroke>
        </div>
        <p>
            Glimpse counts as traveling for the Rupture, that's basically it, of course add a Force Staff (or 2) here
            for extra brain damage. Grimmstroke's Soulbind just makes it twice as ridiculous. So the combo goes like
            this:
            Soulbind - Rupture - all Force Staves you have - Glimpse
        </p>
    </div>

            <img data-id=lich>
        </div>
        <p>
            Double chainfrost is just ridiculous, one chainfrost is good enought already but with soul bind you
            basically have a free refresher. Of course you don't want Lich and Grimmstroke on the same lane so Weaver is
            a nice Ink Swell enabler, and also minus armor with silence combines really well together because the enemy
            won't be able to kill both the Swarm and Phantom at the early stage
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">

            <img data-id=pudge>
        </div>
        <p>
            Muerta provides a failry easy fear with a move direction control which makes hook landings way easier.
            I don't need to tell you how much successful hooks affect the lane winning
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">

            <img data-id=witchDoctor>
            <img data-id=io>
        </div>
        <p>
            it seems the amplification of heal is actually a big deal, it's really hard to kill those two and damage
            output
            is quite decent
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">

        <p>
            That's a hardlane combo with ridiculous magic damage amplification, slows from decrepify and soul bind make
            things worse for your enemy
        </p>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo" id="silencer-skymage">

            <img data-id=silencer>
        </div>
        <p>
            Arcane curse takes advantage of an instant silence from skymage amplyfying the damage output, also skymage
            has some decent nukes to ruin the carry's life on the lane
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=zeus>

            <img data-id=warlock>
        </div>
        <p>
            Double fatal bonds and zeus cast (including double arc lightning), that just hurts. Might want to add a
            Bloodseeker to buff the Zeus even further
        </p>

    <div class="comboWrapper">

            <img data-id=drink>
        </div>
        <p>
            Shadow Demon can spread damage dealt to a hero among enemy heroes, and that works with self harming. Get an
            ethereal blade on Huskar and you will get the one shot most of the time. Don't forget to drink your Long
            Island before the game!

        <p>
            New aghanim in 7.33 for Lancer makes his spear bounce 3 times, that makes 6 illusions with the soul
            bind, and you can cast it twice during the duration, that makes 12 illusions that just shatter enemies
            down, you need a moonshard here since illusions take all your attack speed

        <p>
            2 bushes fire is actually pretty strong on the lane and quite easy to execute with the Earth Spirit. Also
            this 2 heroes are both quite strong on their own.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
            2 extremely strong ultimates, but that's not even the point. It's very easy to win the lane due to minus
            armor and heavy physical damage from eidolons so you just remove the enemy carry most of the time. Yes it's
            pos-4 Tide and pos-3 Enigma

        <p>
            First, both are in the meta now (7.33d), second, you place some proximity mines and then spectre haunts the
            prey and
            finishes the business, it could work with spirit breaker as well, but spectre is just faster. Also the
            minefield, if you succeed placing it inside the fight, and then Spectre haunts, people will die

        <p>
            I honestly think Fatal Bonds and Chainfrost are the most powerful spells when doubled with the Soul Bind,
            especially in the early game. If you manage to pick all of those 3 thought the damage output must be crazy.
            Consider buying aether lense for safer positions in the fights.
            One of these heroes should go mid since you can't have 3 supports and for the carry and offlane position I'd
            suggest Phantom Lancer\assassin and Nature's Prophet\Legion Commander

            That's actually really funny, you replicate enemies skills with morph and Rubick, and than the other 3
            create their illusions, imaging picking it against a spectre or phantom lancer

            Those 2 aghanim shards combined would produce 100 DPS (with almost no effort) inside ice shards with ice
