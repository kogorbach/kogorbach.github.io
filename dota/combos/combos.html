            Both are line dominators in 7.32C, Undying adores C
            M mana regen. Just please buy bunch of mangos on both of
            them

            Matrix reduces cooldown with level 20 talent, if you add Octarine core the Willow won't get out of realm
            duration for like 20 sec. Also Willow is just crazy now (7.32C), get the Ocrarine and Shadow Realm talents
            -> you will have like about 1.5 sec window without the realm, you can spend this time in the Eul's,
            basically only DPS item you need is the Witchblade
        </p>

            With Bloodrage and Overcharge buffs, Zeus will deal about 1.5 damage ONLY wiht his ult in mid-game. Keep
            in
            mind you need the spell damage talent on Bloodseekr and Agh's shard on IO

            Besides from the call and Death Ward combo which is already extremely good, battle hunger and
            maledict at
            lvl 1 thrown at the enemy support will make his life at the lane miserable, to make things worse for
            your
            enemy try rushing urn on WD and keep in mind that Axe is a gread Wraith Pact buyer (WP is op in
            7.32C),
            optimal timing for it is
            right after Vanguard-blink (maybe blademail)

            Apparently (need to test honestly) Nature's Wrath is a point target skill, that means you can
            take advantage
            of Grimm's ult for it, and the damage is ridiculous, you basically have a free refresher at
            level 6.
            Ultimately you want to add a global vision here so you also want a <b> Zeus or Spectre </b>
