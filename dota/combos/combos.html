            <img data-id=crystalMaiden />
        </div>
        <p>
            Both are line dominators in 7.32C, Undying adores CM mana regen. Just please buy bunch of mangos on both of
            them
        </p>

        <p>
            Matrix reduces cooldown with level 20 talent, if you add Octarine core the Willow won't get out of realm
            duration for like 20 sec. Also Willow is just crazy now (7.32C), get the Ocrarine and Shadow Realm talents
            -> you will have like about 1.5 sec window without the realm, you can spend this time in the Eul's,
            basically only DPS item you need is the Witchblade
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=bloodseeker />
            <img data-id=io />
            <img data-id=zeus />
        </div>
        <p>
            With Bloodrage and Overcharge buffs, Zeus will deal about 1k damage ONLY wiht his ult in mid-game. Keep in
            mind you need the spell damage talent on Bloodseker and Agh's shard on IO
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=axe />
            <img data-id=witchDoctor />
        </div>
        <p>
            Besides from the call and Death Ward combo which is already extremely good, battle hunger and maledict at
            lvl 1 thrown at the enemy support will make his life at the lane miserable, to make things worse for your
            enemy try rushing urn on WD and keep in mind that Axe is a gread Wraith Pact buyer (WP is op in 7.32C),
            optimal timing for it is right after Vanguard-blink (maybe blademail)
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=naturesProphet />
            <img data-id=grimmstroke />
        </div>
        <p>
            Apparently, Nature's Wrath is a point target skill, that means you can take advantage
            of Grimm's ult for it, and the damage is ridiculous, you basically have a free refresher at level 6.
            Ultimately you want global vision here, so you also want to<b> add a Zeus or Spectre </b>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=snapfire>

            <img data-id=pangolier>
        </div>
        <p>
            Just get a Maelstrom on all of them, they do a bunch of hits quite quickly due to their
            respective abilities
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class="combo">
            <img data-id=grimmstroke />
            <img data-id=bountyHunter />
        </div>
        <p>
            Bounty Hunter rushes aghanim to enable his damage and steal all money. Add Grimm's ult and double it
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="comboWrapper">
        <div class name="combo">
            <img data-id = zeus>
            <img data-id = naturesProphet>
            <img data-id = sniper>
            <img data-id = aa>
            <img data-id = spectre>
        </div>
        <p>
            Extremely high (or global) range abilities, harass or even kill enemies without giving them chance to
            respond.
            You can of course take this combo partially, pick any 2-3 heroes from here, it's still good
        </p>
