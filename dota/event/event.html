<img src="poster.jpg" class="center">

<p>During the event, players that are playing with Kostyan and Boyaren are able receive a free Aghanim's scepter! How
    does this work:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Pick a hero with a strong Aghanim's scepter bonus, we highly recommend Dark Willow and Clinkz</li>
    <li>Alchemist goes for a position 3 but frees the lane for his support as soon as he gets his Radiance</li>
    <li>Don't suck at the midlane</li>
    <li>Try your best to make stacks</li>
    <li>Enjoy your scepter, but after the Dark Willow ðŸ˜œ</li>
    <li>After 2 scepters Alchemist buys his tank items and you go finish</li>
</ol>
